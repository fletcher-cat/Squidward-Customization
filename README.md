Squidward Helps You Customize Your Windows Installation

To download, go here: https://github.com/fletcher-cat/Squidward-Customization/releases

Click the .zip file and extract. The 'assets' folder and the .exe file must be in the same folder.

Then you simply run the .exe and let Squidward handle the rest.

I couldn't make it exactly how it looked in the original, but I think this is close enough while working on modern Windows versions
